# LoRa Learns Less Forgets Less

## Overview

This project investigates the hypothesis **"LoRA learns less, forgets less"** by comparing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with full fine-tuning and baseline models. We focus on evaluating the performance of fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa models across various tasks related to natural language understanding.

## Motivation

Fine-tuning large language models often results in significant forgetting of previously learned tasks when adapted to new tasks. LoRA offers a parameter-efficient alternative to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while maintaining competitive performance. This project evaluates whether LoRA can indeed learn efficiently and forget less compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, specifically on natural language understanding tasks.

## Related Work

In May 2024, Biderman et al. published a paper titled "LoRA Learns Less and Forgets Less," which explores the performance of LoRA in fine-tuning large language models. The study compares LoRA with full fine-tuning across domains like programming and mathematics, highlighting LoRA's ability to maintain the base model's performance on tasks outside the target domain. The paper is available on arXiv: [LoRA Learns Less and Forgets Less](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09673).

## Experiment Setup

- **Baseline models:**
  - BERT
  - RoBERTa

- **Training Approaches:**
  - **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** Utilizing low-rank adaptation to update fewer parameters.
  - **Full Fine-Tuning:** Updating all model parameters.
  - **Baseline:** Original pre-trained models without additional fine-tuning.

- **Benchmark:**
  - **GLUE Benchmark Tasks Used:** 
    - MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)
    - MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)
    - SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)
    - QQP (Quora Question Pairs)
    - CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)
    - RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)

## Methodology

1. **Individual Task Fine-Tuning:**
   - Each model (BERT and RoBERTa) was fine-tuned on 6 GLUE tasks using LoRA and full fine-tuning strategies.

2. **Evaluation:**
   - Post-fine-tuning, the models were evaluated on all 6 GLUE tasks.
   - Metrics focused on learning efficiency (performance gains) and task retention (the extent of forgetting).

3. **Comparison:**
   - A comparative analysis was performed to understand the trade-offs between reducing the number of trainable parameters (via LoRA) and maintaining task performance.

## Results

- **Key Findings:**
  - **LoRA's Effectiveness:** The LoRA method demonstrated a reduction in forgetting compared to full fine-tuning.
  - **Competitive Performance:** Despite using fewer trainable parameters, LoRA maintained competitive performance on most GLUE tasks.
  - **Learning Efficiency:** The efficiency of parameter updates in LoRA supports the hypothesis that learning less (i.e., updating fewer parameters) can lead to less forgetting.
